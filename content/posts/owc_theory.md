title = 'Developing an analytical model for wave energy extracting breakwaters'
+++

In this study we develop an analytical model in order to optimize and further understand the physical mechanisms behind the proposed [hybrid breakwater](https://clintreyes2.github.io/clintreyes.github.io/posts/owc_expt/) design which incorporates a wave energy converter into a slotted breakwater.

This consists of
