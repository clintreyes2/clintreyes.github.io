<!-- ## Introduction -->

Hi I'm **Clint** a PhD student at the Ocean and Resources Engineering Department at the *University of Hawaii at Manoa*, USA. I am currently working on the development of efficient modeling tools for wave energy converters, specifically complex designs of oscillating water columns (OWC). 
My interests include marine renewable energy (e.g. wave and offshore wind energy), coastal engineering (e.g. nearshore hydrodynamics of waves and currents, wave breaking, coastal erosion, coral reef and nature based solutions), wave generation and air-sea interaction, fluid mechanics and turbulence. 

I am originally from the Philippines which drives my interest in the ocean and the coast. 
I also worked for three years as a coastal engineer with experience in tropical cyclone and tsunami modeling.
